# Project Euler
These are my open source solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).

Feel free to contribute if you find a better solution!

Find the logic to my solutions at [ALGO.md](https://github.com/jaruserickson/project-euler-solutions/blob/master/ALGO.md)!

Each solution in code will include an expanded and min-mode(if possible) answer. Solutions are in the best runtime complexity I could achieve.

My goal for this repo is to help others understand why computer science is so important in programming - this is why I've added [ALGO.md](https://github.com/jaruserickson/project-euler-solutions/blob/master/ALGO.md) to explain and brute force algorithms to contrast the CS solutions! :smile:
